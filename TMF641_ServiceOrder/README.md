# Conformance Test Kit (CTK) for the TMF641 Service Order API

A CTK is a script that can be imported into [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Newman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/collection_runs/command_line_integration_with_newman) to exercise all aspects of a [TMF Open-API](https://www.tmforum.org/open-apis/) specification and test the responses of an implementation.

If your implementation passes the tests proposed by this script, it can be said to be compliant to the relevant version of this TM Fourm Open-API specification. For more details on [TM Forum endorsed product conformance certification can be found here](https://www.tmforum.org/conformance-certification/open-api-conformance/).
